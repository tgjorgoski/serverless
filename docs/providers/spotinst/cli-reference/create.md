## Examples

### Creating a new service

```bash
serverless create -t spotinst-nodejs -n my-special-service
```

This example will generate scaffolding for a service with `Spotinst` as a provider and `nodejs` as runtime. The scaffolding
will be generated in the current working directory.


### Creating a named service in a (new) directory

```bash
serverless create -t spotinst-nodejs -p my-new-service
```

This example will generate scaffolding for a service with `Spotinst` as a provider and `ruby` as runtime. The scaffolding
will be generated in the `my-new-service` directory. This directory will be created if not present. Otherwise Serverless
will use the already present directory.
