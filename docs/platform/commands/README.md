## Beta CLI Commands

Logging in to the platform enables access to beta features of the Serverless framework.

### [`serverless run`](./run.md)
Start local development mode for a Serverless service. This mode downloads and installs the [event-gateway](https://github.com/serverless/event-gateway) and the [serverless emulator](https://github.com/serverless/emulator). Both of these are used to emulate a serverless service and develop against them locally.

### [`serverless emit`](./emit.md)
Emit an event to an event-gateway.

### [`serverless login`](./login.md)
Register or log in to the platform.

### [`serverless logout`](./logout.md)
Logout of the platform.
